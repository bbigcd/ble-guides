# 理解&优化 BLE 的吞吐量

This article highlights the factors which control BLE throughput when using GATT and the knobs you will need to turn to maximize it. 

When trying to learn about BLE throughput, I was frustrated by the lack of good notes on the topic ... so that is what this article sets out to do!

If you are trying to improve the throughput of your BLE application or just want to understand more about the BLE protocol stack in general, please read on!

# 术语

Before we get started there's a few basic definitions that are useful to know.

* **连接事件** - For BLE, *exactly* two devices are talking with each other in one *connection*. Even if data is not being exchanged, each side must ping each other periodically to ensure the *connection* is still alive. Each time the devices ping one another is known as a *Connection Event*

* **连接间隔** - The time between each *Connection Event* (valid time range is 7.5ms to 4 seconds). The *Connection Interval* can be negotiated once the two devices are connected. To optimize for power, it is often favorable to change the *Connection Interval* dynamically

# 理解 LE 包层

To optimize throughput, it is first important to look at the makeup of a Bluetooth LE packet.

## 蓝牙 基带 / 无线电

The BLE Radio is capable of transmitting 1 symbol per μs (giving it a bitrate of 1 megabit/second). This is **not** the throughput which will be observed for several reasons:

1. There is a mandatory *150μs* delay that must be between each packet sent (known as the *Inter Frame Space (T_IFS)*)
2. BLE is a *reliable transport* meaning every packet of data sent from one side must be acknowledged (ACK'd) by the other. The size of an *ACK* packet is *80bits* and thus takes *80μs* to transmit.
3. The maximum data packet is 41 bytes (*328 bits*) and thus takes 328μs to transmit.

### 数据交换示例

## 链路层包(LL)

This is the format used for data sent over the air. All higher level messages are packed within *Data Payloads* of *LL Packets*. Below is what a LL Packet looks like:

![Data exchange](ble_throughput_pics/ll_packet.png)

### 最大的LL数据有效负载吞吐量

The exchange of one packet of data involves:

* Side A sends a maximum size LL data packet (*27* bytes of data)
* Side B receieves the packet and waits T_IFS (*150μs*)
* Side B sends an ACK LL packet (*0* bytes of data)
* Side A waits T_IFS and then can stop sending or transmit more data

Based on the discussion above, the time this sequence takes can be computed:

`328μs data packet + 150μs T_IFS + 80μs ACK + 150μs T_IFS = 708μs`

During this time period, 27 bytes of actual data can be transmitted which takes 216μs.

This yields a data throughput of:

`(216μs / 708μs) * 1Mbit/sec = 305,084 bits/second = 38.1kBytes/s`

## L2CAP 通道&有效载荷

L2CAP is the higher level protocol packed inside the **Data Payloads** of the LL packets. L2CAP allows:

* unrelated data flows to be multiplexed across different virtual *channels* 
* fragmenting and de-fragmenting data across multiple LL Packets (since an L2CAP payload can span multiple LL Packets)

There are only a few different L2CAP channels used for LE:

1. **Security Manager protocol (SMP)** - for BLE security setup
2. **Attribute protocol (ATT)** - Android & iOS both offer APIs that allow 3rd party apps to control transfers over this channel. 
3. **LE L2CAP Connection Oriented Channels** - Custom channels which could be very advantageous for streaming applications. However, there are not 3rd party APIs for this on mobile platforms today so it's not very useful in practice today

### L2CAP 包

## 属性协议(ATT)包

In the *L2CAP Information Payload* we have the ATT packet. This is the packet structure the *GATT* protocol which BLE devices use to exchange data with each other. The packet looks like this:

![Data exchange](ble_throughput_pics/att_packet.png)

### GATT 协议最高吞吐量

The Attribute Protocol *Handle Value Notification* is the best way for a server to stream data to a client. The *Opcode Overhead* for this operation is 2 bytes. That means there is 3 bytes of ATT packet overhead and 4 bytes of L2CAP overhead for each ATT payload. We can determine the max ATT throughput by taking the max LL throughput and multiplying it by the efficiency of the ATT packet:

`ATT Throughput = LL throughput * ((MTU Size - ATT Overhead) / (L2CAP overhead + MTU Size))`

#### 按 ATT MTU 大小可实现的最大吞吐量
MTU size (bytes)         | Throughput (kBytes/sec) |
-------------            | -------------           |
23 (default)             |  28.2                   |
185 (iOS 10 max)         |  36.7                   |
512 (bluetooth max)      |  37.6                   |

### GATT 的实际吞吐量

In practice, the achievable throughput rates are further restricted by the devices being used. Some common limiting factors are:

* The number of packets which can be transmitted in one *connection event*. An entire *connection event* could be filled with data but many devices will only transmit several packets per event.
* For devices which will only send a few packets per *connection event*, it then becomes important to try and make the *connection interval* very short so data can be sent often. However, devices will often only support a portion of the 7.5ms - 4s range.
* Max MTU size supported by the device (many BT chips in Android devices drop data when the size is greater than the default of 23)
* BT LE, BT Classic & Wifi share the same antenna / chip / scheduler and so bursts of wifi/classic traffic can reduce how many packets of LE data will be sent per *connection event*

Below I'll walk through two practical phone examples and their peak *GATT* throughput. Do note that often a developer will add another protocol on top of *GATT* to stream data. The scheme chosen can also have a significant impact on the throughput.

#### Example 1 - iOS 10 / iPhoneSE

##### Background
For iOS < 10, ~4-6 packets are transmitted per connection interval and the max MTU size supported is 158 bytes. For iOS 10, many iOS devices now support 185 byte MTU and 7 packets per connection interval.

When you connect to a BLE device with iOS, it will start with a *connection interval* of 30ms (or 11.25ms if the device supports HID over GATT). However, it is possible to negotiate the interval down to 15ms once connected. Do note that depending on how many packets a device is capable of transmitting, a lower connection interval may not impact performance because the device could fill all the space in a larger *connection interval* with packets.

##### Achievable Throughput
The following assumes a 15ms conn interval, 185 byte ATT MTU size and that 7 Data packets and be transmitted and acknowledged per *connection interval*

First let's make sure we can transmit 7 packets in 15ms:
` 7 * (328μs Data + 150μs + 80μs ACK + 150μs) = 4.956ms`

Now that we know the packets fit, we can take the duty cycle we are achieving and multiply it by the ATT throughput maximums tabulated above.

`Data Rate = (4.956ms / 15ms) * 36.7 kBytes/Sec = 12.2 kBytes/sec`

#### Example 2 - Nexus 5x

The Nexus 5x has one of the better performing BLE chips I've seen to date. It is willing to fill an entire *Connection Event* with packets and supports an MTU size of 512 bytes. With a connection interval of 15ms, I've seen as many as 21 packets transmitted. This takes:

`21 * (328μs Data + 150μs + 80μs ACK + 150μs) = 14.868ms`

Unfortunately, this seems a bit too overzealous and the chip often skips transmitting any data for the following connection event effectively halving the duty cycle. This still yields a pretty impressive throughput:

`Data Rate = (14.868ms / 30ms) * 37.6 kBytes/sec = 18.6 kBytes/sec`

*Full disclosure:* The Android BLE ecosystem is *very* diverse and while some devices perform quite well, others devices perform very poorly. I've even seen some Android devices only capable of transmitting 1 packet per connection interval!
